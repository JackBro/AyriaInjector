AyriaInjector
-----

This module is more or less just calling the awesome [Blackbone](https://github.com/DarthTon/Blackbone) library to create a process
and inject our bootstap module into it. 
The [NativeBootstrap](https://github.com/AyriaPublic/NativeBootstrap) modules need to be in the same directory as this exe.

Usage: `AyriaInjector.exe "Game path" "Game exe" [Startup arguments]`
